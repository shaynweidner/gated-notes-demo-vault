# Gated Notes - Demo Vault

Welcome! This Obsidian vault serves as a live demonstration for the [Gated Notes plugin](https://github.com/shaynweidner/obsidian-gated-notes). It's designed to help you get up and running quickly so you can see the core features in action.

The vault is pre-configured with the Gated Notes and BRAT plugins, along with settings and a sample chapter that has already been processed and contains flashcards.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

Follow these steps to use this demo vault:

1.  **Get the Vault:**
    *   Click the green "Code" button on this GitHub repository page.
    *   Select "Download ZIP" and unzip the folder to a location of your choice.
    *   *(Alternatively, if you're familiar with Git, you can clone the repository).*

2.  **Open in Obsidian:**
    *   Open your Obsidian application.
    *   Click the "Open another vault" icon (the vault symbol) in the bottom-left sidebar.
    *   Select **"Open folder as vault"**.
    *   Navigate to and select the `gated-notes-demo-vault` folder you just downloaded/cloned.

3.  **Enable Plugins & Add API Key:**
    *   When you open the vault, Obsidian may ask for your permission to trust the author and enable community plugins. Please **enable them**.
    *   Navigate to **Settings > Community Plugins > Gated Notes**.
    *   Enter your **OpenAI API Key**. The plugin's AI features will not work without it.

4.  **Explore!**
    *   Open the note `Chapter 2 - Overview of Supervised Learning` from the file explorer.
    *   **Important:** Switch to **Reading View** (the book icon in the top-right corner) to see the gated content. The note will appear empty in Edit View because of how the plugin processes finalized notes.

## âœ¨ How This Vault Was Created

This demo provides a real-world example of the plugin's workflow. Here's how the included note was created:

1.  **PDF to Markdown:** The note was initially generated by processing the PDF of Chapter 2 of ["The Elements of Statistical Learning"](https://hastie.su.domains/ElemStatLearn/) (a book freely available online) using the Gated Notes `Gated Notes: Convert PDF to Note (Experimental)` command.
2.  **Manual Cleanup:** The initial LLM output is powerful but not perfect. I manually cleaned up the markdown, corrected formatting, and added relevant images from the PDF to create a high-quality source note.
3.  **Finalization:** Once the note was ready, I used the `Gated Notes: Finalize note (auto-paragraphs)` command. This transforms the note into the gated HTML format you see in Reading View.
4.  **Flashcard Generation:** Finally, I used the `Gated Notes: Generate flashcards for this note` command. The settings are pre-configured in this vault, and I provided the following custom guidance to the AI:
    > "Do not worry about specific examples (e.g. the Iris dataset) but rather worry about important definitions, concepts, and formulas."

Note that although I asked for 103 cards, it generated 171; it usually gets much closer to the requested amount.
This process showcases how you can turn dense source material into an interactive, reviewable learning experience with Gated Notes.

Enjoy exploring the plugin!
